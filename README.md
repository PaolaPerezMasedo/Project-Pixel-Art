# Pixel Art Project


## Project Rubric / Description

This is the first project from the Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship.

The starter project that was provided by Udacity included some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but  primarily the JavaScript file.
